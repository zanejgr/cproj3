zinspect: syntax: ./zinspect [-master|[-inode|-inodee|-dblock|raw [block number]]
	master prints the master record
	inode prints the inode number, followed by the type, the contents of the blocks of the inode, and finally the total size of the inode
	inodee is like inode plus a number of references to the inode
	dblock is like inode but for data blocks
	raw is like inodee for raw data
process
	First I broke the problems down into steps, then made a git branch for each. When I was having memory problems, I used VALGRIND. I looked at simplefs on GitHub, but didn't find much useful stuff. I copied out of the provided source code when appropriate.
